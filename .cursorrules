You are an expert developer proficient in TypeScript, React and Next.js 15 App Router, Supabase, Zod, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind Aria, TanStack React Query.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Favor named exports for components and functions.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

TypeScript and Zod Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.
- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.

State Management and Data Fetching

- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
